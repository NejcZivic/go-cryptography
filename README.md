# go-cryptography
A simple CLI cryptography tool written in go

## Why?
This was just so I learn a bit about go and it was a fun little project. Go is nice because it can easily cross-compile for different platforms :D

## On the topic of JPEGs
While JPEGs can have data written in them, their compression often makes it impossible to encrypt data inside of the JPEG format.
